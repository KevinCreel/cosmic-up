---

## Quick Start
>
> **Tip:** Be patient! Installing/updating packages/apps takes time! (15+ minutes). Go grab a coffee. ‚òï

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Create a VM** (e.g., with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) using the [Cosmic ISO](https://system76.com/cosmic).
3. **Customize**: Edit Ansible variables to suit your preferences (see below)
4. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes and push to your fork
5. **Clone your fork** onto your fresh Cosmic install
6. **Run the full setup:**

   ```sh
   make
   ```

   This will:
   - Upgrade system packages
   - Set up Ansible in a Python virtual environment
   - Run the Ansible playbook to configure your system

7. **Reboot** if prompted (the upgrade step may require it). After rebooting, run:

   ```sh
   make
   ```

   again to complete the setup.

> **Tip:** Use `make help` to see all available commands and what they do.

### Main Makefile Targets

- `make` ‚Äì Full setup: upgrade, ansible, playbook (recommended)
- `make playbook` ‚Äì Run the Ansible playbook only (all enabled roles)
- `make playbook EXTRA_ARGS="--tags docker"` ‚Äì Run only the `docker` role
- `make playbook EXTRA_ARGS="--tags docker,packages"` ‚Äì Run `docker` and `packages` roles
- `make tags` ‚Äì List all available Ansible tags in the playbook (one per line)
- `make upgrade-packages` ‚Äì Upgrade system packages only
- `make ansible-setup` ‚Äì Set up Ansible and dependencies only
- `make clean` ‚Äì Clean up temporary files and Ansible artifacts
- `make clean-venv` ‚Äì Remove the Ansible Python virtual environment
- `make help` ‚Äì Show all available targets and descriptions (with colorized examples)

#### Example: Full Setup (default)

```sh
make
```

#### Example: List all available tags

```sh
make tags
```

#### Example: Run only the fish and github_cli roles

```sh
make playbook EXTRA_ARGS="--tags fish,github_cli"
```

## Configuration

All user configuration for Cosmic OS is managed in a single file:

```
ansible/group_vars/all.yml
```

**This file is the single source of truth for customizing your setup.**

- Enable or disable roles
- Set host, firewall, user, and application preferences
- Add custom firewall rules, fonts, plugins, and more

**To customize your setup:**
1. Open `ansible/group_vars/all.yml` in your editor.
2. Edit the variables as needed. For example:

```yaml
# Enable or disable roles
enabled_roles:
  enable_docker: true
  enable_ufw: true

# Set your timezone and hostname
timezone: America/New_York
hostname: cosmic

# Add custom UFW firewall rules
ufw_custom_rules:
  - rule: allow
    port: 22
    proto: tcp
```

> **Do not edit other variable files for user-level configuration‚Äîmake all changes in `all.yml`.**

For more details and examples, see the comments in `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`.

### Enabling/Disabling Features

You can quickly turn features on or off by editing the variables in `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`.  
Set each feature to `true` (enable) or `false` (disable):

```yaml
# ansible/group_vars/all.yml

enable_docker: true      # Install and configure Docker
enable_nerd_fonts: false # Skip Nerd Fonts installation
enable_ollama: true      # Install Ollama and Open WebUI
```

This makes your setup highly customizable‚Äîjust edit `all.yml` before running `make`.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during setup, try the following steps:

### Common Issues & Solutions

- **Install hangs or fails:**
  - Press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the process.
  - Re-run the setup with:

    ```sh
    make
    ```

  - If prompted for a reboot, reboot your system and run `make` again.

- **Ansible errors or playbook failures:**
  - Check the error message in your terminal for details.
  - Run the linter to check for common issues:

    ```sh
    ./ansible-venv/bin/ansible-lint
    ```

  - Make sure your Ansible variables are valid YAML and all required variables are set.

- **Missing dependencies or command not found:**
  - Ensure you are not running as root (do not use `sudo make`).

- **Permission errors:**
  - The scripts should be run as your normal user (not root).
  - If you see permission denied errors, check file permissions and try again.

- **Reboot required:**
  - If the upgrade step prompts for a reboot, reboot your system and then re-run `make` to continue.
